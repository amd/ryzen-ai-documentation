Server Interface (REST API)
###########################

The Lemonade SDK offers a server interface that allows your application to load an LLM on Ryzen AI hardware in a process, and then communicate with this process using standard ``REST`` APIs. This allows applications written in any language (C#, JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.) to easily integrate with Ryzen AI LLMs.

Server interfaces are used across the LLM ecosystem because they allow for no-code plug-and-play between the higher level of the application stack (GUIs, agents, RAG, etc.) with the LLM and hardware that have been abstracted by the server. For more information, see the `Understanding local LLM Servers Guide <https://lemonade-server.ai/docs/server/concepts/>`_.

For example, open source projects such as `Open WebUI <#open-webui-demo>`_ have out-of-box support for connecting to a variety of server interfaces, which in turn allows users to quickly start working with LLMs in a GUI.


************
Server Setup
************

Lemonade Server can be installed via the Lemonade Server Installer executable by following these steps:

1. Make sure your system has the recommended Ryzen AI driver installed as described in :ref:`install-driver`.
2. Download and install ``Lemonade_Server_Installer.exe`` from the `latest Lemonade release <https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/releases>`_.
3. Launch the server by double-clicking the ``lemonade_server`` shortcut added to your desktop.

For a visual walkthrough of this process, watch our Lemonade Introductory Video:

       </iframe>
   </div>

See the `Lemonade Server Documentation <https://lemonade-server.ai/docs/>`_ for more details.

************
Server Usage
************

The Lemonade Server provides the following OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

- POST ``/api/v1/chat/completions`` - Chat Completions (messages to completions)
- POST ``/api/v1/completions`` - Text Completions (prompt to completion)
- POST ``/api/v1/responses`` - Chat Completions (prompt|messages -> event)
- GET ``/api/v1/models`` - List available models

Please refer to the `server specification <https://lemonade-server.ai/docs/server/server_spec/>`_ document for details about the request and response formats for each endpoint. 

The `OpenAI API documentation <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses?api-mode=chat>`_ also has code examples for integrating streaming completions into an application. 

Supported Applications
======================

The Lemonade Server supports a variety of applications that can connect to it using the OpenAI API. Some of the applications that have been tested with Lemonade Server can be found at `Lemonade Server Apps <https://lemonade-server.ai/docs/server/apps/>`_.
