Model Quantization 
##################


Quantization is the process of converting model weights and activation values from floating-point to lower-precision integer representations. Quantized models are more power-efficient, utilize less memory, and offer better performance. Ryzen AI requires INT8 quantization for inference. 

***************************
Vitis AI Quantizer for ONNX
***************************

**Vitis AI Quantizer for ONNX**: Provides an easy-to-use Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) flow on the pre-trained model saved in the ONNX format. It generates a quantized ONNX model ready to be deployed with the Ryzen AI Software.

This is the recommended quantization flow for CNN-based models. 

For more details, refer to the :doc:`vai_quant/vai_q_onnx` section of this documentation.


************************
Other Quantization Flows
************************

The Ryzen AI Software supports other quantization tools that can be used in specific situations: 

**Vitis AI Quantizer for PyTorch**: Allows quantizing models through the PyTorch framework. This flow supports both PTQ and quantization-aware training (QAT) to improve model accuracy. For more details, refer to the :doc:`vai_quant/pt` section of this documentation.

**Vitis AI Quantizer for TensorFlow**: Allows quantizing models through the TensorFlow framework. This flow supports both PTQ and QAT to improve model accuracy. For more details, refer to the :doc:`vai_quant/tf2` section of this documentation.

**Vitis AI Quantizer for Olive**: The Microsoft Olive framework provides a plugin allowing to use the Vitis AI Quantizer. Developers familiar with the Olive framework may use this flow to quantize their models. For more details, refer to the :doc:`olive_quant` section.
