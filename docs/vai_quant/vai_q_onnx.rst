Vitis AI Quantizer for ONNX 
###########################

********
Overview
********

The AMD Vitis AI Quantizer for ONNX models supports various configurations and functions to quantize models for deployment on IPU_CNN, IPU_Transformer, and CPU. It is customized based on the `Quantization Tool <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/main/onnxruntime/python/tools/quantization>`_ in ONNX Runtime.

The Vitis AI Quantizer for ONNX supports Post Training Quantization. This static quantization method first runs the model using a set of inputs called calibration data. During these runs, the tool computes the quantization parameters for each activation. These quantization parameters are written as constants to the quantized model and used for all inputs. The quantization tool supports the following calibration methods: MinMax, Entropy, Percentile, and MinMSE.

.. note::
   In this documentation, **"NPU"** is used in descriptions, while **"IPU"** is retained in the tool's language, code, screenshots, and commands. This intentional 
   distinction aligns with existing tool references and does not affect functionality. Avoid making replacements in the code.

Running vai_q_onnx
******************
  
Quantization in ONNX refers to the linear quantization of an ONNX model. The ``vai_q_onnx`` tool is as a plugin for the ONNX Runtime. It offers powerful post-training quantization (PTQ) functions to quantize machine learning models. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a technique to convert a pre-trained float model into a quantized model with little degradation in model accuracy. A representative dataset is needed to run a few batches of inference on the float model to obtain the distributions of the activations, which is also called quantized calibration.

Use the following steps to run PTQ with vai_q_onnx.


1. Preparing the Float Model and Calibration Set 
================================================

Before running ``vai_q_onnx``, prepare the float model and calibration set, including these files:

- Float model: Floating-point models in ONNX format.
- Calibration dataset: A subset of the training dataset or validation dataset to represent the input data distribution; usually 100 to 1000 images are enough.

**Exporting PyTorch Models to ONNX**

For PyTorch models, it is recommended to use the TorchScript-based onnx exporter for exporting ONNX models. For more details, refer to the `PyTorch documentation <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx_torchscript.html#torchscript-based-onnx-exporte>`_

Tips:

- Before exporting, perform model.eval().
- Models with opset 13 are recommended.
- For CNN's on NPU platform, dynamic input shapes are currently not supported and only a batch size of 1 is allowed. Ensure that the shape of input is a fixed value, and the batch dimension is set to 1.

Example code:

.. code-block::
   
   torch.onnx.export(
      model,
      input,
      model_output_path,
      opset_version=13,
      input_names=['input'],
      output_names=['output'],
   )


.. note::
   * **Opset Versions**:The ONNX models must be opset 10 or higher (recommended setting 13) to be quantized by Vitis AI ONNX Quantizer. Models with opset < 10 must be reconverted to ONNX from their original framework using opset 10 or above. Alternatively, you can refer to the usage of the version converter for `ONNX Version Converter <https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/VersionConverter.md>`_
   
   * **Large Models > 2GB**: Due to the 2GB file size limit of Protobuf, for ONNX models exceeding 2GB, additional data is stored separately. Please ensure that the .ONNX file and the data file are placed in the same directory. Also, set the `use_external_data_format` parameter to True for large models when quantizing.


2. (Recommended) Pre-processing on the Float Model
==================================================

.. note:: 
   ONNX model optimization cannot output a model size greater than 2GB. For models larger than 2GB, the optimization step must be skipped.

Pre-processing transforms a float model to prepare it for quantization. It consists of the following three optional steps:

- Symbolic shape inference: It is best-suited for transformer models.
- Model Optimization: This step uses the ONNX Runtime native library to rewrite the computation graph, including merging computation nodes, and eliminating redundancies to improve runtime efficiency.
- ONNX shape inference.

The goal of these steps is to improve the quantization quality. The ONNX Runtime quantization tool works best when the tensor’s shape is known. Both symbolic shape inference and ONNX shape inference help figure out tensor shapes. Symbolic shape inference works best with transformer-based models, and ONNX shape inference works with other models.

Model optimization performs certain operator fusion that makes the quantization tool’s job easier. For instance, a Convolution operator followed by BatchNormalization can be fused into one during the optimization, which can be quantized very efficiently.

Pre-processing API is in the Python module ``onnxruntime.quantization.shape_inference``, function ``quant_pre_process()``.

.. code-block::

   from onnxruntime.quantization import shape_inference

   shape_inference.quant_pre_process(

3. Quantizing Using the vai_q_onnx API
======================================

The static quantization method first runs the model using a set of inputs called calibration data. During these runs, the quantization parameters for each activation are computed. These quantization parameters are written as constants to the quantized model and used for all inputs. Vai_q_onnx quantization tool has expanded calibration methods to power-of-2 scale/float scale quantization methods. Float scale quantization methods include MinMax, Entropy, and Percentile. Power-of-2 scale quantization methods include MinMax and MinMSE.

If the model has multiple inputs, it can be fed in list (shape) format, where the list order is the same as the onnxruntime got inputs. For example, random_data_reader_input_shape=[[1, 1, 224, 224], [1, 2, 224, 224]] for 2 inputs. Moreover, it is possible to use dict {name : shape} to specify a certain input, for example, random_data_reader_input_shape={"image" : [1, 3, 224, 224]} for the input named "image".

   The current release of the Vitis AI Execution Provider ingests quantized ONNX models with INT8/UINT8 data types only. No support is provided for direct deployment of models with other precisions, including FP32.


In addition to the INT8/UINT8, the VAI_Q_ONNX API supports quantizing models to other data formats, including INT16/UINT16, INT32/UINT32, Float16, and BFloat16, which can provide better accuracy or be used for experimental purposes. These new data formats are achieved by a customized version of QuantizeLinear and DequantizeLinear named "VitisQuantizeLinear" and "VitisDequantizeLinear", which expand onnxruntime's UInt8 and Int8 quantization to support UInt16, Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float16, and BFloat16. This customized Q/DQ was implemented by a custom operations library in VAI_Q_ONNX using onnxruntime's custom operation C API.

The custom operations library was developed based on Linux and does not currently support compilation on Windows. If you want to run the quantized model that has the custom Q/DQ on Windows, it is recommended to switch to WSL as a workaround.

To use this feature, the ```quant_format``` should be set to VitisQuantFormat.QDQ. The ```quant_format``` is set to ```QuantFormat.QDQ``` for accelerating both CNN's and transformers on the NPU target. 



1. Quantizing Float32 Models to Int16 or Int32 
==============================================


The quantizer supports quantizing float32 models to Int16 and Int32 data formats. To enable this, you need to set the "activation_type" and "weight_type" in the quantize_static API to the new data types. Options are ```VitisQuantType.QInt16/VitisQuantType.QUInt16``` for Int16, and ```VitisQuantType.QInt32/VitisQuantType.QUInt32``` for Int32.

.. code-block::

   vai_q_onnx.quantize_static(
      model_input,
      model_output,
      calibration_data_reader,
      calibrate_method=vai_q_onnx.PowerOfTwoMethod.MinMSE,
      quant_format=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantFormat.QDQ,
      activation_type=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantType.QInt16,
      weight_type=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantType.QInt16,
   )


2. Quantizing Float32 Models to Float16 or BFloat16
===================================================


Besides integer data formats, the quantizer also supports quantizing float32 models to float16 and bfloat16 data formats by setting the "activation_type" and "weight_type" to ```VitisQuantType.QFloat16``` or ```VitisQuantType.QBFloat16``` respectively.

.. code-block::

   vai_q_onnx.quantize_static(
      model_input,
      model_output,
      calibration_data_reader,
      calibrate_method=vai_q_onnx.PowerOfTwoMethod.MinMSE,
      quant_format=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantFormat.QDQ,
      activation_type=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantType.QFloat16,
      weight_type=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantType.QFloat16,
   )


3. Quantizing Float32 Models to Mixed Data Formats
==================================================


The quantizer supports setting the activation and weight to different precisions. For example, activation is Int16 while weight is set to Int8. This can be used when pure Int8 quantization does not meet the accuracy requirements.

.. code-block::
      
   vai_q_onnx.quantize_static(
      model_input,
      model_output,
      calibration_data_reader,
      calibrate_method=vai_q_onnx.PowerOfTwoMethod.MinMSE,
      quant_format=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantFormat.QDQ,
      activation_type=vai_q_onnx.VitisQuantType.QInt16,
      weight_type=QuantType.QInt8,
   )

*************************
Quantizing Float16 Models
*************************


For models in float16, it is recommended to set "convert_fp16_to_fp32" to True. This will first convert your float16 model to a float32 model before quantization, reducing redundant nodes such as cast in the model.

.. code-block::
      
   vai_q_onnx.quantize_static(
      model_input,
      model_output,
      calibration_data_reader,
      quant_format=QuantFormat.QDQ,
      calibrate_method=vai_q_onnx.PowerOfTwoMethod.MinMSE,
      activation_type=QuantType.QUInt8,
      weight_type=QuantType.QInt8,
      enable_dpu=True,
      convert_fp16_to_fp32=True,
      extra_options={'ActivationSymmetric':True}
   )

*******************************************
Converting NCHW Models to NHWC and Quantize
*******************************************


NHWC input shape typically yields better acceleration performance compared to NCHW on NPU. VAI_Q_ONNX facilitates the conversion of NCHW input models to NHWC input models by setting "convert_nchw_to_nhwc" to True. Please note that the conversion steps will be skipped if the model is already NHWC or has non-convertable input shapes.

.. code-block::
      
   vai_q_onnx.quantize_static(
      model_input,
      model_output,
      calibration_data_reader,
      quant_format=QuantFormat.QDQ,
      calibrate_method=vai_q_onnx.PowerOfTwoMethod.MinMSE,
      activation_type=QuantType.QUInt8,
      weight_type=QuantType.QInt8,
      enable_dpu=True,
      extra_options={'ActivationSymmetric':True},
      convert_nchw_to_nhwc=True,
   )

*****************************************
Quantizing Using Cross Layer Equalization
*****************************************

Cross Layer Equalization (CLE) is a technique used to improve PTQ accuracy. It can equalize the weights of consecutive convolution layers, making the model weights easier to perform per-tensor quantization. Experiments show that using CLE technique can improve the PTQ accuracy of some models, especially for models with depthwise_conv layers, such as MobileNet. Here is an example showing how to enable CLE using VAI_Q_ONNX.

.. code-block::
      
   vai_q_onnx.quantize_static(
      model_input,
      model_output,
      calibration_data_reader,
      quant_format=QuantFormat.QDQ,
      calibrate_method=vai_q_onnx.PowerOfTwoMethod.MinMSE,
      activation_type=QuantType.QUInt8,
      weight_type=QuantType.QInt8,
      enable_dpu=True,
      include_cle=True,
      extra_options={
         'ActivationSymmetric':True,
         'ReplaceClip6Relu': True,
         'CLESteps': 1,
         'CLEScaleAppendBias': True,
         },
   )

**Arguments**

* **include_cle**: (Boolean) This parameter is a flag that determines whether to optimize the models using CrossLayerEqualization; it can improve the accuracy of some models. The default is False.

* **extra_options**: (Dictionary or None) Contains key-value pairs for various options in different cases. Options related to CLE are:

  -  **ReplaceClip6Relu**: (Boolean) If True, Replace Clip(0,6) with Relu in the model. The default value is False.
  -  **CLESteps**: (Int) Specifies the steps for CrossLayerEqualization execution when include_cle is set to true, The default is 1, When set to -1, an adaptive CrossLayerEqualization steps will be conducted. The default value is 1.  
  -  **CLEScaleAppendBias**: (Boolean) Whether the bias be included when calculating the scale of the weights, The default value is True.
